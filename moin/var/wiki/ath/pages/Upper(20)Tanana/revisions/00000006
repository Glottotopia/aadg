== Location ==
Upper Tanana (ISO 639-3: tau) is spoken in eastern interior Alaska and the western Yukon Territory. There are no exact speaker counts, but there are probably between 50 and 90 speakers, many of them elderly.

== Dialects ==
There are five dialects of Upper Tanana: Beaver Creek, Scottie Creek, Northway, Nabesna, and Tetlin. The Scottie Creek dialect is not spoken by anyone anymore, but is documented through the work of James Kari with Mary Tyone, which led to a collection of stories (Tyone 1996). All other dialects are still spoken; the dialect with the largest number of speakers is probably the Northway dialect.

== Data on this website ==
Almost all of the Upper Tanana data on this website has been collected by Olga Lovick. Each sentence contains “metadata” that tell you the speaker, dialect information, date of the recording, and other information. As the website grows, we hope to include information from other sources as well; the origin of that data will be indicated in the metadata.

Many of the sentences on here are taken from narratives. Additional data has been elicited to highlight particular structures. We checked with the speakers that all sentences are OK to be on the internet, so they contain no sensitive, secret, or sacred information. If you find a problematic sentence, please contact Olga at Olga@lithophile.com or by phone (see tab “Contact” for full information).''' '''

·               Information on all dialects has been included (the original source only contained information on the Tetlin dialect)

·               Phonemic representations have been added

=== Introduction ===
'' ''

Upper Tanana Athabascan contains many sounds that do not exist in English. Other sounds are similar to English ones, but are pronounced a little differently. In this section, we discuss the sounds and their spelling.

By trying to accommodate different audiences, we chose two ways of explaining the sounds. For linguists, we include vowel and consonant charts in the hope that they are self-explanatory. For those with no or little knowledge of linguistics, we include discussions of the sounds and their spelling, comparing them with sounds familiar from English.

Upper Tanana spelling is a lot easier and more consistent than English spelling. Think of how the ''ou'' is pronounced in the English words ''rough, though, ''and'' through''—three different ways! In Upper Tanana, words are always pronounced the way they are written. So once you have learned how the sounds are written, you can pronounce all Upper Tanana words by looking at how they are written.

Below, we describe all sounds in different ways, but this is not as good as hearing the sounds. For this reason, we recommend that the reader visit [[http://www.lithophile.com/olga/ut/ut-alphabet/|www.lithophile.com/olga/ut/ut-alphabet/]] to listen to the sounds of the Upper Tanana alphabet pronounced by several different speakers.

Some sounds are written by single letters (for example '''''a''''', '''''m''''', '''''ł'''''), some by combinations of letters ('''''oo''''', '''''tth''''', '''''k’'''''). Sounds written by letter combinations are still single sounds! In cases where a letter combination actually represents two sounds that happen to occur next to each other, we indicate this by a hyphen. For example, '''''k’''''' is one sound in the word ''k’įįł'' ‘birch sap’, but it is two sounds in the word ''nak-’įh ''‘I saw’.

=== Vowels ===
Vowels are sounds where the flow of air through the mouth is not obstructed in any way and is merely modified through the position
