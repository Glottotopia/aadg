=== Question words ===

Open-ended questions always contain a question word. The following question words are discussed on this page:

* ''doo'' 'who' [[#doo-summary|jump to this section]] 
* ''dii'' 'what’ [[#anchorname|label text]]
* ''nts’ąą’'' 'how, what’, ''dii xa'' 'why’, ''ndehde’'' 'when (future)’, ''ndehdą’'' 'when (past)’, ''ndee'' 'where precisely’ and ''nduugn'' 'whereabouts’. When asking questions with ''ndee'' 'where’, you need to distinguish between plain ''ndee'' 'where at’, ''ndee nts’ą̈’'' 'where to’ and ''ndee ts’änh'' 'where from’. In the next sections, examples for each question words will be shown. More examples can be found by filtering for the question word in the main interface.

=== ''Doo'' 'who' ===<<Anchor(doo-summary)>>

''Doo'' 'who’ can be used to ask after noun that describes a human being: you can ask about the subject, the direct object, the postpositional object, and the possessor. The following example shows how to ask about a direct object.

When you ask about the subject or possessor, ''doo'' is often followed by the focus particle ''ch’a'', which always triggers nominalization of the verb. When you ask about the direct or postpositional object, ''ch’a'' is not used, and nominalization is optional.

=== ''Dii'' 'what' ===

''Dii'' `what’ can be used to ask after nouns describing concrete, inanimate entities. You can ask about the subject, direct object, or postpositional object using ''dii''; there is no example where ''dii'' is used to ask about a possessor. 

''Dii'' is almost always followed by the focus particle ''ch’a'', which usually triggers nominalization of the verb. 

It is important to remember that ''dii'' may only be used to ask after entities that can be touched! If you want to ask about abstract entities (e.g. 'what are you doing’ or 'what are you thinking’), ''nts’ąą’'' must be used. See discussion of ''nts’ąą’'' below.

=== ''Nts'ąą''' 'how, what' ===

''Nts’ąą’'' 'what, how’ is used to ask after the way something is done, or after abstract entities such as thoughts, words, or actions.

In this example, the speaker inquires about the manner in which an action is performed.
