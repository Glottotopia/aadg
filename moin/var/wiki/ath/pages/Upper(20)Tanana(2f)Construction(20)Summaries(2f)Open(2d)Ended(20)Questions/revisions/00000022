Open-ended questions always contain a question word. The following question words are discussed on this page:

 * [[#doo-summary|doo 'who']] 
 * [[#dii-summary|dii 'what']]
 * [[#ntsaa-summary|nts’ąą’ 'how, what’]]
 * [[#diixa-summary|dii xa 'why’]]
 * [[#ndeh-summary|ndeh 'when’]]
 * [[#ndee-summary|ndee 'where']]
 * [[#nday-summary|nday 'whoah, where']]

In the next sections, examples for each question words will be shown. Upper Tanana makes some distinctions that English doesn't make, so be sure to read each section completely. More examples for each question word can be found by in the main database. 

<<Anchor(doo-summary)>>
=== Doo 'who' ===

''Doo'' 'who’ can be used to ask after noun that describes a human being: you can ask about the subject, the direct object, the postpositional object, and the possessor. The following example shows how to ask about a direct object.

When you ask about the subject or possessor, ''doo'' is often followed by the focus particle ''ch’a'', which always triggers nominalization of the verb. When you ask about the direct or postpositional object, ''ch’a'' is not used, and nominalization is optional.

<<Anchor(dii-summary)>>
=== Dii 'what' ===

''Dii'' `what’ can be used to ask after nouns describing concrete, inanimate entities. You can ask about the subject, direct object, or postpositional object using ''dii''; there is no example where ''dii'' is used to ask about a possessor. 

''Dii'' is almost always followed by the focus particle ''ch’a'', which usually triggers nominalization of the verb. 

It is important to remember that ''dii'' may only be used to ask after entities that can be touched! If you want to ask about abstract entities (e.g. 'what are you doing’ or 'what are you thinking’), ''nts’ąą’'' must be used. See discussion of ''nts’ąą’'' below.

<<Anchor(ntsaa-summary)>>
=== Nts'ąą' 'how, what' ===

''Nts’ąą’'' 'what, how’ is used to ask after the way something is done, or after abstract entities such as thoughts, words, or actions.

In this example, the speaker inquires about the manner in which an action is performed.

||<tableclass="idselector">||<<Anchor(UTOLVDN07Aug2205-053)>>||

In the following example, ''nts’aa’'' (a common variant of ''nts’ąą’'') is used to inquire about an abstract entity.

<<Anchor(diixa-summary)>>
=== Dii xa 'why, what for' ===

''Dii xa'' 'why, what for' consists of the question word ''dii'' 'what' and the postposition ''xa, aa'' 'for'. It is pronounced by some people as ''dii xa'', by others more like ''diaa'', the different pronunciations do not change the meaning. ''Dii xa'' asks about the cause or motivation of an event. 

||<tableclass="idselector">||<<Anchor( UTOLAF12Jul1201-057)>>||

Even when ''dii xa'' 'why, what for' occurs without the focus particle ''ch'a'', it almost always triggers nominalization of the verb. (In both examples in the database, this is not visible.)

<<Anchor(ndeh-summary)>>
=== Ndeh 'when' ===

Asking a question about the time of an event is a little more complex in Upper Tanana, because you need to know (and indicate) whether the event you're asking about is in the future or in the past. If you ask about an event in the future, you need to use ''ndehde’'', which consists of ''ndeh'' 'when' and ''de’'' 'if, at a point in time in the future'. The verb in a question with ''ndehde’'' is usually inflected for the Future mode.

||<tableclass="idselector">||<<Anchor(UTOLAF14Apr2501-070 )>>||

If you ask about an event in the past, you need to use ''ndehdą’'', which consists of ''ndeh'' 'when' and ''dą’'' 'at a point in time in the past'. The verb in a question with ''ndehdą’'' is usually inflected in the Perfective mode. 

||<tableclass="idselector">||<<Anchor( UTOLAF14Apr2501-064)>>||

By itself, ''ndeh'' is not really a word, and you can never ask a question using just ''ndeh''!

<<Anchor(ndee-summary)>>
=== Ndee 'where' ===

Questions about 'where' are a little complicated. Different forms are used depending on whether you ask about the location of an item or about the direction of movement.

If you ask about the direction of movement, you need to indicate the direction of movement. If you want to ask about where the movement is coming from, you need to use ''ndee ts'änh'' 'where from'. (''Ts'änh'' is a postposition meaning 'from').

||<tableclass="idselector">||<<Anchor(UTOLAF14Apr2501-090)>>||

If you want to ask about the direction that the movement is going in, you need to use ''ndee nts'ą̈’'' 'where to'. (''Nts'ą̈’'' is a postposition meaning 'to'; it is often pronounced and written without the initial ''n''.)

||<tableclass="idselector">||<<Anchor(UTOLAF14Apr2501-086)>>||

If you ask about the location of an item, or where an event took place, you use ''ndee'' 'where'. Questions formed with ''ndee'' 'where' usually contain a verb.

<<Anchor(nday-summary)>>
=== Nday 'whoah, where' ===

The more common way of asking about the location of an item is to use ''nday''. When ''nday'' occurs all by itself, it is an exclamation meaning 'whoah!' or 'what the heck!'. But when ''nday'' is used together with a noun, it forms a question 'Where is [noun]?'. These sentence usually do not contain a verb.
