== Open-ended questions ==
(For yes/no-questions, please see close-ended questions)

Open-ended questions always contain a question word such as ''doo'' /'who/', ''dii'' `what’, ''nts’ąą’'' `how, what’, ''dii xa'' `why’, ''ndehde’'' `when (future)’, ''ndehdą’'' `when (past)’, ''ndee'' `where precisely’ and ''nduugn'' `whereabouts’. In forms with ''ndee'' `where’, you need to disinguish between plain ''ndee'' `where at’, ''ndee nts’ą̈’'' `where to’ and ''ndee ts’änh'' `where from’.

Doo `who’ can be used to ask after noun that describes a human being: you can ask about the subject, the direct object, the postpositional object, and the possessor. (Search for doo in the interface to get a complete list of examples)

When you ask about the subject or possessor, doo is usually followed by the focus particle ch’a, which always triggers nominalization of the verb. When you ask about the direct or postpositional object, ch’a is not used, and nominalization is optional.

Dii `what’ can be used to ask after nouns describing concrete, inanimate entities. You can ask about the subject, direct object, or postpositional object using dii; there is no example where dii is used to ask about a possessor. (Search for dii in the interface to get a complete list of examples.)

Dii is almost always followed by the focus particle ch’a, which always triggers nominalization of the verb.

It is important to remember that dii may only be used to ask after entities that can be touched! If you want to ask about abstract entities (e.g. `what are you doing’ or `what are you thinking’), nts’ąą’ must be used.

Nts’ąą’ `what, how’ is used to ask after the way something is done, or after abstract entities such as thoughts, words, or actions.
