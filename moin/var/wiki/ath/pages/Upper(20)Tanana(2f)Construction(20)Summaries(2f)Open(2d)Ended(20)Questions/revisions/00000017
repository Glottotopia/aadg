=== ''Doo'' 'who' ===

''Doo'' 'who’ can be used to ask after noun that describes a human being: you can ask about the subject, the direct object, the postpositional object, and the possessor. The following example shows how to ask about a direct object.

When you ask about the subject or possessor, ''doo'' is often followed by the focus particle ''ch’a'', which always triggers nominalization of the verb. When you ask about the direct or postpositional object, ''ch’a'' is not used, and nominalization is optional.

<<Anchor(dii-summary)>>
=== ''Dii'' 'what' ===

''Dii'' `what’ can be used to ask after nouns describing concrete, inanimate entities. You can ask about the subject, direct object, or postpositional object using ''dii''; there is no example where ''dii'' is used to ask about a possessor. 

''Dii'' is almost always followed by the focus particle ''ch’a'', which usually triggers nominalization of the verb. 

It is important to remember that ''dii'' may only be used to ask after entities that can be touched! If you want to ask about abstract entities (e.g. 'what are you doing’ or 'what are you thinking’), ''nts’ąą’'' must be used. See discussion of ''nts’ąą’'' below.

''Nts’ąą’'' 'what, how’ is used to ask after the way something is done, or after abstract entities such as thoughts, words, or actions.

In this example, the speaker inquires about the manner in which an action is performed.

||<tableclass="idselector">||<<Anchor(UTOLVDN07Aug2205-053)>>||

<<Anchor(diixa-summary)>>
=== Dii xa 'why, what for' ===

''Dii xa'' 'why, what for' consists of the question word ''dii'' 'what' and the postposition ''xa, aa'' 'for'. It is pronounced by some people as ''dii xa'', by others more like ''diaa'', the different pronunciations do not change the meaning. ''Dii xa'' asks about the cause or motivation of an event. 

||<tableclass="idselector">||<<Anchor( UTOLAF12Jul1201-057)>>||

Even when ''dii xa'' 'why, what for'' occurs without the focus particle ''ch'a'', it almost always triggers nominalization of the verb.
