<<Anchor(gen-summary)>>
=== “Gen” ‘what' ===

In Koyukon, questions about concrete objects - things - are formed using the word “Gen” ‘what’.  “Gen” is similar to “debaa” in that it can serve as a subject, object or postpositional object.  

||<tableclass="idselector"> || <<Anchor(KO50Q044 )>> ||

||<tableclass="idselector"> || <<Anchor(KO50Q047 )>> ||


In English we often use the word “what” to ask about abstract things - thoughts, events, situations.  “Gen” is not used for these kinds of questions in Koyukon; “Do-questions” (see below) are used instead. 



<<Anchor(doq-summary)>>
=== “Do” Questions ===

do-questions ask about abstract things or descriptions, and have The most common do-questions are the common greetings ‘How are you?’ and ‘What are you doing?’   English translations that use the words what (in the case of things) and how (in the case of descriptions.   

||<tableclass="idselector"> || <<Anchor(KO50Q051 )>> ||

||<tableclass="idselector"> || <<Anchor(KO50Q049 )>> ||

The do-question is formed with the question element do immediately preceding a verb.   Not all verbs can work with do.   The examples in AAGD include verbs of being, saying, thinking, and certain kinds of description.  do-questions about abstract things use words for speaking or thinking.

||<tableclass="idselector"> || <<Anchor(KO50Q048 )>> ||

||<tableclass="idselector"> || <<Anchor(KO50Q029 )>> ||

do-questions about descriptions include questions about size, shape, distance and length of time.

<<Anchor(nedawhere-summary)>>
=== Neda  ‘where’ ===

Questions asking ‘where’ regarding a destination use a form of the question word neda along with a locational suffix.   In this example, the suffix “ghe” is added to indicate that the question is about the general direction, not a particular place.  

||<tableclass="idselector"> || <<Anchor(KO50Q036 )>> ||

For asking about the location of people and things, there is a shortcut form that is not suffixed: 

||<tableclass="idselector"> || <<Anchor(KO50Q043)>> ||


<<Anchor(nedaawhen-summary)>>
=== Nedaa 'when' ===

Questions asking ‘when’ use different forms depending on whether the time in question is in the past or in the future.   For a question about future time, “nedaa” is suffixed with “-dodedaa’.”  

||<tableclass="idselector"> || <<Anchor(KO50Q033 )>> ||

If you are asking about an event in the past, “neda” is suffixed with “-don”.  

||<tableclass="idselector"> || <<Anchor(KO50Q035 )>> ||


<<Anchor(nedaats’e-summary)>>
=== Nedaats’e ‘how’ ===

Questions asking ‘how’ use a compound of “nedaa” (INT) with “ts’en’” or “ts’e” (‘in manner’).   These forms are also used for questions about numbers and properties of people and objects.   This is the way to ask about a person’s name in Koyukon.

<<Anchor(why-summary)>>
=== Asking ‘why’ ===

Questions asking ‘why?’ use a number of different forms.   Some “why” questions use “nedaats’e” (‘how’).    

||<tableclass="idselector"> || <<Anchor(KO50Q014 )>> ||

Others use “Gen” with a postposition, so the meaning of “why” becomes more like “for what” or “in pursuit of what”. 

||<tableclass="idselector"> || <<Anchor(KO50Q013 )>> ||

||<tableclass="idselector"> || <<Anchor(KO50Q012 )>> ||

“Do-Questions” can also be found translated with “why.”
