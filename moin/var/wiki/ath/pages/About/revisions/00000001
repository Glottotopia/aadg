== Intellectual property ==
Please  be aware that many individuals have been involved in the creation of  this tool, and all of them retain the intellectual property to their  contributions.

Individual examples are the  intellectual properties of the speakers who produced them. When known,  we indicated this in the metadata. For some old data, we do not know who  the speaker is.

Analyses are the intellectual properties of the annotators. These are:

 * For Koyukon, these are Eliza Jones and Siri Tuttle.
 * For Lower Tanana, this is Siri Tuttle.
 * For Upper Tanana, these are Olga Lovick, Falene Karey-McKenna, and Caleb Brucks.

The database and interface were created by and are the intellectual property of Sebastian Nordhoff. (Add something about open-source etc.)
