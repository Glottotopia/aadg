= Lower Tanana/Constructions/Do-Question =

''do''-questions ask about abstract things or descriptions, and have English translations that use the words ''what'' (in the case of things) and ''how'' (in the case of descriptions). 

== Form ==

The ''do''-question is formed with the question element ''do'' immediately preceding a verb.   Not all verbs can work with ''do''.   The examples in AAGD include verbs of being, saying, thinking, and certain kinds of description.

== Function ==
The most common do-questions are the common greetings ‘How are you?’ and ‘What are you doing?’
